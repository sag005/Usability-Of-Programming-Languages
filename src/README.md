### Tasks
1. Get the first table optimally
2. Reduce already served items to get final bill amount
3. Merge two tables with served and pending items. Iterate over both lists to change the resulting table number.
 (think about the destruction of original 2 tables and creation of new, once the bill is paid for the new restore original tables)
