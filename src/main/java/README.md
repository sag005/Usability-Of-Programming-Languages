### Tasks

Observation/code explanation tasks:
Please go through the whole code base to get an understanding of it.
Afterwards, specifically go through the code in Restaurant.java, methods "getTable", "getAvailableTable", "
getAvailableServer" and write a brief description of what you feel the methods are doing.

Description:

getTable:
getAvailableTable:
getAvailableServer:

Coding/modifying tasks:

1. Get the optimal table available: Implement the function getOptimalAvailableTable() in such a way that it returns a
   table whose capacity is just greater than the guest count.
2. Reduce already served items to get final bill amount: Implement the function generateBill() in Table.java.
3. Reduce all the tables to get final money made by the restaurant by calculating all the table's generateBill() and
   summing up.
